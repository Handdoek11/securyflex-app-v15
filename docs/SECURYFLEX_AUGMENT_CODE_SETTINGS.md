### **USER GUIDELINES SECTION (Best Practices)**
```markdown
# üéØ SECURYFLEX DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES - BEST PRACTICES

## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING
Securyflex is a Dutch security marketplace platform with:
- Multi-role ecosystem: Guards, Companies, Admins with distinct workflows
- Enterprise-grade security: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- Dutch-first business logic: KvK validation, postal codes, currency formatting
- Template consistency: 100% compliance with Flutter UI Template standards
- Unified design system: Complete implementation with role-based theming

Current Status: ‚úÖ Design System Complete, ‚úÖ 68+ Tests, ‚úÖ Performance Standards Met, ‚úÖ Dutch Localization Complete

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION

### Pre-Implementation Protocol
BEFORE any coding task, ALWAYS execute this sequence:
1. üìö Read docs/UNIFIED_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for current design standards
2. üîç Use codebase-retrieval to understand existing patterns and architecture
3. üéØ Identify which unified components are available for your use case
4. üé≠ Determine which user roles (Guard/Company/Admin) will use this feature
5. üá≥üá± Plan Dutch localization and business logic requirements
6. üß™ Design test strategy to meet 90%+ coverage standards
7. üìä Consider performance impact on established metrics

### Implementation Order (Non-Negotiable)
1. DESIGN SYSTEM FIRST: Use existing UnifiedHeader, UnifiedButton, UnifiedCard components
2. BUSINESS LOGIC SECOND: Implement Dutch validation, authentication, role-based access
3. USER INTERFACE THIRD: Build UI using unified components, test with all user roles
4. TESTING THROUGHOUT: Write tests as you implement (not after)
5. LOCALIZATION & PERFORMANCE: Add Dutch strings, validate performance metrics

## DESIGN SYSTEM BEST PRACTICES

### Component Selection Guide
‚úÖ PREFERRED: Use unified components
- UnifiedHeader.simple(title: 'Beveiligingsopdrachten', userRole: UserRole.guard)
- UnifiedButton.primary(text: 'Solliciteren', onPressed: () {})
- UnifiedCard.standard(userRole: UserRole.company, child: content)

### Role-Based Theming Strategy
Build theme-aware components that automatically adapt to user roles:
```dart
Widget buildJobCard(JobData job, UserRole userRole) {
  return UnifiedCard.standard(
    userRole: userRole,  // Automatic theme application
    child: Column(
      children: [
        Text(job.title, style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleMedium?.copyWith(
          fontWeight: DesignTokens.fontWeightSemiBold,
        )),
        UnifiedButton.primary(
          text: userRole == UserRole.guard ? 'Solliciteren' : 'Bekijk Kandidaten',
          onPressed: () => _handleJobAction(job, userRole),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

## DUTCH-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

### Business Logic Integration
- Currency: NumberFormat.currency(locale: 'nl_NL', symbol: '‚Ç¨')
- Dates: DateFormat('dd-MM-yyyy', 'nl_NL')
- Phone: Format as +31 6 12345678 or 020 1234567
- KvK: 8-digit validation with proper formatting
- Postal codes: 1234AB format validation

### String Management
Maintain comprehensive Dutch translations for:
- User roles: 'guard' ‚Üí 'Beveiliger', 'company' ‚Üí 'Bedrijf', 'admin' ‚Üí 'Beheerder'
- Job status: 'pending' ‚Üí 'In behandeling', 'accepted' ‚Üí 'Geaccepteerd'
- Common actions: 'apply' ‚Üí 'Solliciteren', 'cancel' ‚Üí 'Annuleren'

## TESTING EXCELLENCE

### Test Structure Patterns
Comprehensive test coverage with:
- Authentication flow tests for all user roles
- Job application flow tests with realistic scenarios
- Performance tests validating <1s loading requirements
- Integration tests for complete user journeys
- Widget tests for UI component rendering

### Performance Testing Integration
Monitor and validate:
- Dashboard loading: <1000ms
- Screen navigation: <300ms
- Memory usage: <150MB average
- Test execution: All 68+ tests must pass

## SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

### Authentication & Authorization
Implement role-based access control:
- Job posting: Company + Admin only
- Job application: Guard only
- User management: Admin only
- Protected routes with proper authorization checks

### Input Validation Patterns
Comprehensive validation for:
- Email addresses with proper regex
- KvK numbers with 8-digit validation
- Dutch postal codes with 1234AB format
- Phone numbers with Dutch format validation

### When to Ask for Clarification
Request clarification when:
- Business logic requirements are unclear or conflict with existing patterns
- Security implications are complex or require architectural decisions
- Dutch business rules need verification or expansion
- Performance requirements cannot be met with current architecture
- Design system components don't cover new use cases
- Testing strategies need adjustment for complex scenarios

GOAL: Maintain Securyflex as a world-class Dutch security marketplace platform with enterprise-grade reliability, consistency, and user experience while enabling strategic growth and innovation.
