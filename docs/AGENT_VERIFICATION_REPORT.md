Current Mapping:
Primary: flutter-expert + security-auditor
Secondary: business-analyst + legal-advisor

IMPROVED MAPPING:
Primary: flutter-expert + payment-integration
Secondary: security-auditor + business-analyst
```

#### **Real-time Chat System**  
```bash
Current Mapping:
Primary: flutter-expert + performance-engineer
Secondary: security-auditor + test-automator

IMPROVED MAPPING:
Primary: flutter-expert + mobile-developer
Secondary: performance-engineer + security-auditor
```

#### **Company Dashboard Analytics**
```bash
Current Mapping:
Primary: flutter-expert + business-analyst
Secondary: performance-engineer + test-automator

IMPROVED MAPPING:
Primary: flutter-expert + data-engineer
Secondary: business-analyst + performance-engineer
```

#### **Admin Platform Management**

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **PROMPT TEMPLATE VERIFICATION**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **SYNTAX ISSUES FOUND**

#### **Incorrect Agent Invocation Syntax**
```bash
‚ùå Current: "Use the flutter-expert subagent to implement [feature]"
‚úÖ Correct: "Use the flutter-expert agent to implement [feature]"

Note: Claude Code uses "agent" not "subagent" in prompts
```

#### **Missing Tool Access Specifications**
```yaml
Issue: Guide doesn't specify tool access for agents
Required: Each agent should have defined tool permissions

Example:
flutter-expert:
  tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
security-auditor:
  tools: Read, Grep, Bash
test-automator:
  tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
```

## üéØ **CONCLUSION**

The current agent mapping has a solid foundation but requires significant improvements to be optimal for SecuryFlex development. The most critical issues are:

1. **Missing payment-integration agent** for core business functionality
2. **Incorrect syntax** throughout prompt templates  
3. **Suboptimal feature mappings** for key SecuryFlex features
4. **Missing tool access specifications** for proper agent configuration

**Recommendation**: Implement Phase 1 fixes immediately before using the guide in production.
